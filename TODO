# Stuff to do:    
    ✔ watch this video to understand [rooms](https://youtu.be/UymGJnv-WsE) @done(20-03-18 17:47)
    ☐ put all strings in encoded format with variables inside the strings
    ☐ create texas holdem engine (this doesn't look it's found anywhere the way I like it)
        This follows the following steps:
            Six players numbered from 1 to 6, where #2 is to the left of #1 at the table
            Starting round is
            - #1 is the dealer
            - #2 is the small blind (*sb*) bet
            - #3 is the big blind (*bb*) bet
            - *sb* and *bb* put the money on the table as initial amount
            - #1 give 2 cards per player, #1 being the last
            - #4 is the first one to play one of the following actions:
                - call: put the same money as the one before him
                - fold: doesn't play anymore, doesn't recover any money played
                - raise: call action plus at least 1 dollar more        
            - #4 raise
            - #5 call
            - #6 call
            - #1 call
            - #2 call
            - #3 call (last to play)
            - #1 dealer mette tre carte giù, face up (flop)
            - #2 è l'active player e può fare check, bet, o fold
            - si continua finché si continua a fare bet, si finisce se tutti check o fold
            - #1 dealer butta giù altra carta (turn)
            - stesso giro partendo dal #2
            - #1 dealer butta giù altra carta (river)
            - stesso giro partendo dal #2
            - si calcolano le combinazioni ed il vincitore
        
        Giro alternativo, tutti foldano tranne uno.
