        This follows the following steps:
            Player 4 – Calls the big blind (25¢)
            Player 5 – folds
            Player 1 – Calls the big blind (25¢)
            Player 2 – Calls the big blind (since they already have 10¢ bet, they only have to add another 15¢, for a total of 25¢)
            Player 3 – Checks (since they already have the bet matched, they do not need to add more money to call; this is called checking)
